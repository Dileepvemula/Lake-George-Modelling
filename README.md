# Lake-George-Modelling (May 2020)

## Read Data

This model uses data from January 1990 to December 2018. It reads the data as a pandas dataframe object. The code also checks for any missing valuesand imputes them with values that seem relevant to them.  

## Statistics

The model data outputs the following after reading the data and performing computations:
+ Largest area covered by the lake over the years, 
+ Average Volume of the lake over the years,
+ Hottest month on average
+ The month and year whose rainfall is closest to the average rainfall

## Topography

The model plots 2 graphs based on areas, volumes of lake George over the months from 1990 to 2018. The first graph plots percentage change in areas, volumes compared to the initial area and volume of Lake ie, January 1990. The second plot is a graph showing percentage change in areas and volumes compared to its previous month's area and volume.
