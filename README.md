## Read Data

This model uses data from January 1990 to December 2018. It reads the data as a pandas dataframe object. The code also checks for any missing valuesand imputes them with values that seem relevant to them.  

## Statistics

The model data outputs the following after reading the data and performing computations:
+ Largest area covered by the lake over the years, 
+ Average Volume of the lake over the years,
+ Hottest month on average
+ The month and year whose rainfall is closest to the average rainfall
